---------------------------
Guess/MakeGuess validation:
  Options:
    1. Barebones validation in the Model, smart validation in the Service.
      Pros:
        - Model only worries about it's information
      Cons:
        - Have to maintain validation across Model and Service, and test both seperately.

    2. All validation in the Model, Service simply relays result to Controller.
      Pros:
        - All logic about Guess on Model
        - Service is light and doesn't need to be tested
      Cons:
        - Service has to return constants OR true, bad practice

    3. All validation in the Model, including writting to errors[]. Service just creates Model.
      Pros:
        - All logic about Guess on Model
        - Service is really light, just returns result of Model.create
      Cons:
        - Default error messages for validations are not user-friendly

Me: I like 3, very loosely coupled objects.
Jordan: Seems to use 1 in his TicketToRide.
Minns: Leaned towards 3 as well

Decision: 3, with a helper for the view to create nice errors for the user.
